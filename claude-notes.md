# Claude Code Session Notes

## Current Session: Application Initialization

**Current Step**: Step 1 - Requirements Gathering (completed)
**Status**: Documenting app requirements

## App Concept: Real-Life Counter-Strike Game Facilitator

**Core Functionality:**
- Single game/lobby support for up to 10 players (5v5 max, uneven teams allowed)
- Team selection: Terrorist vs Counter-Terrorist
- Host-controlled game settings and round management
- Real-time player status tracking (alive/dead)
- Round timer and bomb countdown functionality

**Key Features:**
- Team selection screen on app open
- Host role: first player to join becomes host
- Host controls: start round, adjust round time (1-20 min), bomb timer (40s-5min)
- Player death button and live team status display
- Real-time game state synchronization

**Target Users:** Groups playing real-life tactical games (laser tag, airsoft, etc.)

## MVP Implementation Plan

**Database Schema:**
- `games` table: gameId, hostId, status, settings (roundTime, bombTime), currentRound
- `players` table: playerId, gameId, userId, team, isAlive, isHost

**User Flows:**
1. Join game → Select team (first player becomes host)
2. Host: Configure settings, start round
3. Players: Mark death, view team status
4. Real-time: Live timer, player status updates

**Routes:**
- `/` - Team selection/lobby
- `/game` - Active game view
- `/host` - Host controls (conditional)

## Session Progress
- ✅ Gathered detailed app requirements
- ✅ Documented requirements and removed template instructions
- ✅ Planned MVP implementation
- ✅ Implemented Convex schema and backend functions
- ✅ Built core UI components (team selection, game interface)
- ✅ Tested implementation with dev servers

## Commits Made During Session
- init: document Counter-Strike game facilitator app requirements
- implement: Counter-Strike game MVP with Convex backend and React UI
- feat: implement bomb planting and defusing mechanics with timer and notifications

## Completed Features
- **Team Selection**: Choose Terrorist/Counter-Terrorist on app open
- **Host Controls**: First player becomes host, can configure timers and start rounds
- **Game Settings**: Round time (1-20 min), bomb timer (40s-5min) with sliders
- **Real-time Game State**: Live player status, team rosters, round timer
- **Player Actions**: "I'm Dead" button, automatic team status updates
- **💣 Bomb System**: Terrorists plant bombs, Counter-terrorists defuse them
- **🎯 Win Conditions**: Elimination, time expiry, bomb explosion/defusal
- **📱 Push Notifications**: Bomb planted/defused alerts with vibration
- **⏱️ Bomb Timer**: Real-time countdown with visual display
- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **Authentication**: Optional - supports both anonymous and authenticated play

## Technical Implementation
- **Backend**: Convex with games, players, users tables
- **Frontend**: React + TanStack Router + daisyUI
- **Real-time**: Convex queries for live updates
- **Auth**: Clerk with proper Convex integration

## Recent Updates
- **Anonymous Play**: Removed authentication requirement - players can join with just a name
- **Session Management**: Uses localStorage session IDs for anonymous users  
- **Flexible Auth**: Supports both authenticated (Clerk) and anonymous users
- **Schema Updates**: Modified database to support optional authentication
- **Bug Fixes**: Resolved game creation validation errors and TypeScript issues
- **🏆 Win Detection**: Automatic round end detection with win conditions
- **📱 Mobile Notifications**: Push notifications even when phone is locked
- **🎉 Winner Celebrations**: Winner modal with audio/vibration feedback
- **📲 Mobile Chrome Fix**: Real-time updates now work properly on mobile
- **⚙️ Service Worker**: Background notifications for locked phones
- **📱 PWA Support**: Progressive Web App with manifest for mobile install
- **💣 BOMB MECHANICS**: Complete bomb planting and defusing system implemented!

## Fixed Issues
- ✅ Schema validation error when creating games
- ✅ TypeScript typing errors for user IDs
- ✅ Game creation flow for anonymous users
- ✅ Backend functions now deploy successfully
- ✅ Build deployment TypeScript errors resolved
- ✅ Removed unused imports and variables
- ✅ Fixed implicit any type errors

## App Ready For Use
The Counter-Strike game facilitator is fully functional and ready for real-life gameplay sessions!
Players can now join immediately without creating accounts - just enter a name and start playing!

## Important Context
- This is a template repository being initialized into a new application
- Full-stack TypeScript: React + Vite + TanStack Router (frontend), Convex (backend), Clerk (auth)
- Need to remove demo content but keep useful layout structure and auth

## Instructions for Future Sessions
If starting fresh, reread the project:init-app command contents in the original message to understand the initialization workflow.
